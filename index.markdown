# Course Description

**Open Source Software Development**

This course prepares students to become active participants in open source projects. It begins with an overview of the philosophy and brief history of open source development, followed by an in-depth look at different types of open source projects and the study of various tools involved in open source development. In particular, it covers the collaborative nature of open source projects, community structure, version control systems, licensing, intellectual property, types of contributions (programming and non-programming) and the tool-chains that enable such contributions.

__The students are expected to contribute to existing open source projects.__



## Objectives and Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this course:
-   will be able to explain to others the nature of open source software, particularly how it differs from proprietary software;
-   will be able to evaluate open source software projects with respect to their maturity, level of activity, community friendliness, and complexity;
-   will be able to find suitable open source software projects in which to participate;
-   will become a contributing member of a software development community;
-   will be able to choose an appropriate license for their creative works in general and to explain what can and cannot be done with software that has a specific license;
-   will be able to explain how software licensing works in general, what choices of license exist; and
-   will be able to give several examples of the ways in which companies earn money in the open source ecosystem.

- [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/)  publishes stories about creating, adopting, and sharing open source solutions. It provides many resources for and about open source and the "open source way", as well as various other useful resources. The open source way is about applying the principles of open source software development beyond software

- [OpenHealthNews.com](http://www.openhealthnews.com/) publishes news, information and resources related to open health

- [foundation.mozilla.org](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/)
is the website of the **Mozilla Foundation**, a  non-profit organization
that is the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox
and other open source tools. Mozilla is involved in many initiatives to keep the Internet
free and open.

- [linuxfoundation.org](https://www.linuxfoundation.org)
is the website of the **Linux Foundation**, which is "dedicated to building
sustainable ecosystems around open source projects to accelerate
technology development and industry adoption."

- [code.gov](https://code.gov/#!/)

maintained by the federal government. As they put it, it
"leverages the power of code sharing and collaboration to
help the U.S. Government cut down on duplicative software development
and save millions of taxpayer dollars for the American people."


# Course Policies

This course follows CAS Academic Policies that can be found at [https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/policies/academic-policies.html](https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/policies/academic-policies.html).  

<!--(Append any course specific policies as applicable)-->


## Attendance

This is an in-person synchronous class and you are expected to attend the lectures and recitations. 

Missing a class or two is reasonable and often unavoidable, but missing more than five course meetings will likely result in decreased understanding of the course content and, hence, lower scores.

If, for any reason, you need to miss a lot of class meetings, you should contact [cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu](mailto:cas.deanforstudents@nyu.edu) for verification and guidance for an extended absence period. 
Extended absences often result in students inability to make-up missed material and assessments. You should consider withdrawing from the class and attempting it again in the future semester.



## Disability Disclosure Statement

New York University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity and participation for students of all abilities. We work with NYU students to determine appropriate and reasonable accommodations that support equal access to a world-class education.

Students requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center for Student Accessibility as early as possible in the semester for assistance.

## Wellness Statement 

In a large, complex community like New York University, it's vital to reach out to others, particularly those who are isolated or engaged in self-destructive activities. Student wellness ([https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/student-wellness.html](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/student-wellness.html)) is the responsibility of us all.

The NYU[ Wellness Exchange](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/wellness-exchange.html) is the constellation of NYU’s programs and services designed to address the overall health and mental health needs of its students. Students can access this service 24 hours a day, seven days a week: [wellness.exchange@nyu.edu](mailto:wellness.exchange@nyu.edu); (212) 443-9999. Students may also call the Wellness Exchange hotline (212-443-9999) or the NYU Counseling Service (212-998-4780) to make an appointment for single session, short-term, or group counseling sessions.


## Academic Integrity


This course follows the university and departmental policies on academic integrity: 

-   [Academic Integrity for Students at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html)
-   [CS Department Academic Integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html "CS Department Academic Integrity")

Our main philosophy is that you need to be honest and fair to yourself, other students in the class and the instructional stuff.


The nature of open source is based on collaborative work. But that work is still performed by individuals.
Your name should not be associated with a contribution that is not your own or that you have not put significant amount
of work into.

# Academic Email Etiquette


* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.

* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.

## Alternative Ways of Finding Contributions

- **[Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)**: A resource that lists projects with tasks specifically for newcomers to the open source community. It allows you to filter by  labels to find suitable issues to work on.

- **[Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)**: This platform curates tasks from various GitHub repositories that are tagged as 'good first issues'.
