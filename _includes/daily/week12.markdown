### Assignments

**Due by the end of Sunday (April 14)**

- (This was listed a few weeks ago so if you read it then, just refresh your memory about it.) In preparation for discussions in class read [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) by Eric S. Raymond (you should be reading the essay titled [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/) in this book, the second link is a direct link to the XHTML format of that essay, there are other formats available at the book site at the first link)

- Visit [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://github.com/ossd-s24/wiki/wiki/The-Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar) page on our course wiki and vote for your favorite quote. 

- Make your blog post. Reflect on the presentation by Christopher Snider. 
How does the use of open source by Tidepool compare to the user of open source 
by enterprise. **Also** reflect on your group's progress. What are some challenges
that you (as a group) need to overcome? What are some challenges that you (as an individual) need to overcome?
