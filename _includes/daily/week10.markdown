### Assignments

Due on a meeting by meeting basis (this includes the days that you work on this
in class): update the wiki page for your group project.
For each time you meet as a group, list

- who was in attendance,
- what you accomplished since last meeting (this should include a mention for each
  item that you hoped to accomplish at a previous meeting and a status of it)
- what your goals are for upcoming days (up to the next meeting and, if applicable,
  longer term goals)
- list any contributions you made (large or small) and their status (pull request made,
  responding to comments from the community, pull request accepted, ...)

Due on April 3: make your next blog post. Reflect on your group's work, progress you made
challenges you faced, surprises you encountered ...
