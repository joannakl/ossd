Contributions you should be working on, [slides](slides/contributions.html)

Finish with [Introduction to FOSS](slides/introduction.html) slides


Code of conduct, samples:
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), originally written by
Coraline Ada Ehmke
- [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/)
- Google's Go [Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct)

(Group) Activity about code of conduct documents.


- Follow the instructions and links in the [Code of Conduct Activity](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd_materials/blob/master/activities/code_of_conduct_activity.md). Have a discussion with your group about the questions posed in the activity.
- On your own, address the questions from the activity in your weekly blog. Do not write the blog as a sequence of questions and answers. Instead, create couple of paragraphs that address the issues. 


### Lecture 2


Create your first open source project (at least, in this class).

Find your team members and make sure you are sitting together so that
you can work together.


The instructions for the activity are at [Browser Add-on Activity](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd_materials/blob/master/activities/browser_add-on_activity.md) repository.

You should keep a Ed live-log during this activity.
- Create a post on Ed in the Add-on Activity category. The title of the post should follow given
template: Team-XXX Live Log, in which you replace the XXX with your team number. 
- List the members of the team in the body of the post. (Note, only one person is able to 
edit the post itself.)
- Log your progress as you complete different parts of the activity using Comment feature on the posts. 
(Note, that this is going to create a list of comments in reverse chronological order with the 
most recent comments on top.) 
- Do not duplicate the answers that you are providing elsewhere. There should be regular entries in the log.
You should no be just summarizing what you did at the very end. Everybody in your team can make comments. 

See a sample [live log](https://edstem.org/us/courses/34501/discussion/2475877) and make sure you create a similar live log to keep track of your group's progress. (The only difference is that the sample has time-stamps on comments that are too close together to be realistic.) 


Readings:
- MDN [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) documentation
