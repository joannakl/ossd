### Assignments

Due by the end of the week (i.e., Sunday)
- ~~Make your blog post for the week. Comment on the videos you watched and the class discussion about them from this week. Were you surprised by anything you learned? What role, do you think, you could play as a computer scientist to address some of the issues mentioned in the discussion and videos?~~ 
- Comment on your _small_ contributions: how are things going, what types of contributions were you able to make? what are the biggest challenges? which contribution are you most proud of? 


- (Continuation from last week) 
Pick an open source project that you may be interested in contributing to (this should be something that you are excited about, something that you think you may want to be working on, something that matches your goals and skills as you outlined them in the _taking stock_ exercise; it also should NOT be one of the projects assigned in the first part of the project evaluation exercise that you completed with a partner last week). Complete the project evaluation and create a file for that project in the [project evaluation](https://github.com/ossd-s25/project-evaluation) repository. 

- Pick a humanitarian / social good type of open source project (again, it should be something that matches your interests, goals, ...).  Complete the project evaluation and create a file for that project in the [project evaluation](https://github.com/ossd-s25/project-evaluation) repository. (If the project was already evaluated, just add `_NUM` to the name to indicate that this is second, third, ... evaluation.) You can pick any project that fits this criteria, but if you need some ideas, here are some:
[Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/splash), [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), [Tidepool](https://www.tidepool.org/),  [OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org/), [Optikey](http://www.optikey.org/), [A

**Due by the end of Sunday (March 3) - THIS IS A HARD DEADLINE!**

- Complete the [project preference](https://forms.gle/2pA8mWuZeYrG3Nfu7) form. The data you provide there will be used to form the project groups for the remainder of the semester. This is completely confidential and will not be shared with anybody other than the instructor.
