### Assignments


Due by the end of the week (i.e., by the end of Sunday)
- Make your blog post. Comment on 
the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first open source project (what 
are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit 
into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions, were there any surprising things you discovered about 
yourself in the process of the group work) 
- Complete the brief quiz on Ed Lessons called _Anatomy of a FOSS project_


Readings:
- the first two chapters in ProGit book  (Getting Started, Git Basics)

Due by February 16
- with your group, continue working on your first project
- make sure that the project follows all the best practices of open source
- prepare a 5 minute presentation about your project (to be delivered in front of the class on Feb 17) - you do not need to make slides,
but you need to decide how to organize your presentation and showcase your work
- one person from each team  should make a post in the
  "First Project Activity" page on the class wiki. (The other people need to view it and make sure that it is there and that it 
  is properly formatted.)
  The post should follow this format: <br/>
  `Team TeamColor, [Project Name](link to the GitHub repo) ` <br/>
  `Team Member 1` <br/>
  `Team Member 2` <br/>
  `Team Member 3` <br/>
  ...
  (Where the `Team TeamColor` is the team color you were given during the in-class session.)
  If you are going to use any slides for the presentation on 2/17 then link them here as well.
