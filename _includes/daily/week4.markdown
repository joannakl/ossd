### Assignments


Due by the end of the week (i.e., by the end of Sunday)

- Read the materials on version control linked to under lecture 2 for this week. Complete
the quiz on Ed Lessons after the reading. 

- Read a few project evaluations created by other students. Focus on projects that you are familiar with or that seem to fit your project preferences. 

- Make your blog post for the week. 
  - Comment on the `git` exercises we did in class. 
  - Comment on project evaluation. What are your thoughts about different projects that you have looked at so far? what are you most excited about regarding working on an opens source project? what do you think will be the biggest challenges? how do you plan to overcome them? 
  

Ongoing
- continue making small personal contributions (keep in mind that they should 
be done on a regular basis and be diverse in terms of their type) 
- start looking at different open source projects from the angle of possible 
contributions (while you are evaluating projects, look at things that you could do right now without diving too much into the project)
