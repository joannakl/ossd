## Version Control System (VCS)

- What is a version control system (and don't say _GitHub_)?

--

  A _version control system_ (or _revision control system_) is a system that
records changes to a set of one or more files so that earlier versions of any
of these files can be restored at a later time. It is often used for managing
software, but it can be used for any types of files, such as  documentation,
web pages, graphics, artwork in general, and chapters of a book.

--

- Why do we need version control?

--

  Software is a precious asset. You spend hours working on it and need to
make sure you do not lose important work. Sometimes you make mistakes, overwrite
things, replace good ideas with bad ones, and so on. Version control allows us
to safely go back to different versions.

  Also, when groups of people work on the same project files, a version control
system helps  prevent lost or conflicting work. It tracks every individual
change by each contributor.

--

- What are some examples of modern version control systems ?

--

    - Git, see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
    - Subversion (or Apache subversion, or SVN), see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion)
    - Mercurial, see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial)

## Assessing Your Background

__Show of hands:__

- Who feels comfortable using a version control system (Git, or anything else)?
    - beginner
    - intermediate
    - expert

--

- Who uses a version control system on a regular basis (for purposes other than class assignments)?

--

- Who uses version control software (e.g., Git) in a terminal window  (rather
 than some GUI based software)?

## VCS Terminology

- __repository__

--

    A database in which changes are stored and from which they are published. <br>
    In a __centralized VCS__, there is a single, main repository. <br>
    In a __distributed__ or __decentralized VCS__, each developer has their own
    repository, and changes can be interchanged among repositories arbitrarily.

---
## VCS Terminology

- __remote versus local repositories__

--

  The repository in which you do your work is your __local__
 repository. A __remote repository__ is a  version of your project that is not
 your local repository. It is usually either  hosted on the Internet, on another
 network, or your own network.  It can even be on your local machine.

  Sometimes you are the owner of the remote repository, because you maintain it
on a website somewhere (such as GitHub), and sometimes the remote is maintained
by someone else.



---
## VCS Terminology

- __clone__

--

    To copy an existing repository from a (usually but not necessarily remote)
   server into a newly created directory on  your local machine.
  (Every version of every file for the history of the   project is copied by default.)

--

- __commit__

--

    To make a change to the project; more formally, to store a change in the version control database in
    such a way that it can be incorporated into future releases of the project.

    "Commit" can be used as
    a verb or a noun. For example: "I just _committed_ a fix for the server crash bug that people have been
    reporting on Mac OS X. Jay, could you please review the _commit_ and check that I'm not misusing the
    allocator there?"
--

- __commit message__ or __log message__

--

    Some commentary attached to each commit, describing the nature and purpose
    of the commit. The more detailed it is, the better it is.

---
## VCS Terminology


- __push__

--

    To publish a commit to a remote repository, usually so that others can
 incorporate it into their copy of the project's code.

    In some VCSs, the remote repository is pre-determined, in others it is user-specified.

--

- __pull__ / update

--

    To incorporate changes/commits present in a remote repository into your own
  copy of the   project.

--

- __working copy__ or __working files__

--

    A developer's private directory tree containing the project's source code files.

    In a distributed VCS, working copies and repositories are usually colocated,
  so the term "working copy" is less often used. Developers instead tend to say
  "my clone" or "my copy" or sometimes "my fork".

    __NOTE__: The repository is not the directory or the files!  The repository is what
  the VCS creates to control and manage the files. We sometimes misuse the word but
  it is an important distinction.

---
## VCS Terminology


- __diff__

--

    A textual representation of a change. A diff shows which lines were changed and how, plus a few lines of surrounding context on either side. A developer who is already familiar with some code can usually read a diff against that code and understand what the change did, and often even spot bugs.

--

- __patch__

--

   A patch is essentially like a diff except that patches are often distributed as
  chunks of code that when run, make the changes to the file to which the patch is applied.

---
## VCS Terminology

- __branch__

--

    A copy of the project, under version control but isolated so that changes
   made to the branch don't affect other branches of the project,
   and vice versa, except when changes are deliberately "merged" from
   one branch to another (see below). Branches are also known as "lines of development".

    Branches offer a way to keep different lines of development from
    interfering with each other. For example, a branch can be used for
    experimental development that would be too destabilizing for the main trunk,
    or for working on new features, or for fixing bugs.

--

- __merge__

--

    To copy the differences found in one branch to another.

---
## VCS Terminology

- __merge conflict__

--

  When the same part of the file has been modified in two different ways a VCS may not
be able to merge the differences together. The changes may be a single line or across different parts of the file. 
In this case, the VCS notifies the human that a __merge conflict__ exists and must be resolved manually.

## The States of a File in Git

- Every file is in exactly one of three states in Git:
  __modified__, __staged__, or __committed__.

  __Modified__ means that you changed the file but have not told Git to record
  the changes in its database.

  __Staged__ means that you have marked a modified file in its current version
  to go into the next "commit snapshot".

  __Committed__ means that the data is safely stored in your local Git database.

--

- Files are either __tracked__ or __untracked__.

  Informally, a file in the working directory is __tracked__ if Git has a record of
  it in its database, whether it is  unmodified, modified, or staged.

  A file is __untracked__ if it is in the working directory but not tracked.

--

  When you first clone a repository, all of the files will be
  tracked and unmodified because Git just created them all for you, so they
  are all in its database, and you have not yet modified them.

---

## What NOT to track: .gitignore

- Not every file in your project folder should be in the repository. 

--

- A `.gitignore` file is a text file where you list patterns of files/directories Git should ignore.

--

- **What usually goes in here?**
 - Compiled code ( `.class`, `.exe`, `.o`)
 - External dependencies ( `node_modules/`, `venv/`)
 - System-specific files ( `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
 - Secret keys and credentials ( `.env`)

--

- Check out [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) to generate templates for your specific language or IDE.


---
## Making Changes with Git


- The basic workflow to modify a file and have Git record the changes:

  1. Make the changes to one or more files. These are changes to the
  working directory (the leftmost part of the figure.)

  1. __Stage__ the changes that you want to be a part of the next commit.

  1. __Commit__ all work that has been staged.

---

## Mental Model: The Loading Dock

Think of your workflow like shipping a crate of parts:

- **Working Directory (Modified):** Your workbench. You are busy fixing parts and creating new ones.

--

- **Staging Area (Staged):** The **loading dock**. You’ve picked the specific parts that are finished and placed them in a shipping crate.

--

- **Local Repository (Committed):** The crate is **sealed and labeled**. It is now a permanent part of the ship's manifest.

--

- **Remote Repository (Pushed):** The crate has been **delivered** to the main warehouse (GitHub).

--

**Why the middle step (staging)?** 

--

Staging allows you to group related changes together, even if you modified 10 different files for 10 different reasons.

- **BUT** these should be **related** changes, not a mishmash of everything you changed in the past few months. (And if you do, make sure you include a commit message that reflect this mishmash.) 


---

## Basic Git Commands: Installing

- Installing Git
    - This depends on your particular system. It can be downloaded from<br>
      https://git-scm.com/downloads

    - It can usually be installed by the package manager in Linux systems.



---
## Basic Git Commands: Configuration

 - Setting up your environment to work with Git in a terminal.

    - Set up your name / user-name / identifier

        `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`

    - Set up your email address:

        `git config --global user.email "John.Doe@worlds.net"`

    - Set up your preferred text editor:

        `git config --global user.editor vi`

    - Tell Git to cache your credentials for a few minutes, so you do not have to
    retype your username and password on every single push

        ` git config --global credential.helper cache`
        
    - (Note that many companies that provide remote git repository hosting now require
    SSH keys, or personal access tokens. Know what you are using.) 

    - Check your current configuration, i.e., list the config state:

        `git config --list`

---
## Basic  Git Commands:  Cloning a Repository

- The Git `clone` command makes a copy of an existing repository in a new
  directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the
  local filesystem or on remote machine accessible through the Git protocol.

  - Given the URL of a remote repository that you have the right to copy, to clone it
     use

        `git clone URL`

      This will make a copy of the remote naming it with the same name as it has on
      the server, in the current working directory.

  - To clone a  repository on the local machine you also use `git clone` but give
    it the path to the existing  repository:

       `git clone PATHNAME`


  - In all cases it creates a `remote reference` named `origin` that "points to"
    the original repository and will be the default for pushing and pulling.


---
## Basic Git Commands: Repository Info

- Getting information about your repository (the local copy of it):

    - Show the working tree status (information about what is staged, what is
    tracked/untracked)

        `git status`

    - Show the list of all of the commits (i.e., the __commit log__) in reverse chronological order

        `git log`

    - Display detailed information about the  remote repository named `origin`:

        `git remote show origin`

    - Display a list of all remote repositories for your repository:

         `git remote -v`

---

## Pro-Tip: Readable History

- The standard `git log` can be overwhelming in large projects.

- Try the "oneline" flag for a bird's-eye view:

 `git log --oneline`
 
--

- To see the "graph" of branches and merges (very helpful later!):

 `git log --oneline --graph --all`
 

---
## Basic Git Commands: Local Workflow

- After you modify some files:

    - Staging your files

         `git add file1 file2 ...`

    - Commit all staged files

          `git commit -m "one line commit message enclosed in quotes" `

    -  Or, selectively commit some staged files, say `file1` and `file2`

           `git commit -m "one line commit message enclosed in quotes" file1 file2`

--

- If you modify a tracked file, you can commit without staging.
  Say you modified `file1` after committing.

    - Commit the tracked, modified file `file1`:

           `git commit -m "changed file1 again" file1`

---

## Basic Git Commands: Pushing

- You worked on your local copy of a repository and now want to update the
  remote, the one you cloned from. By default the remote is named `origin`.

     - To "push" those changes, in this simple case, you can use

          `git push`

        or for clarity

          `git push origin`

        For even more clarity, you are pushing your __main branch__ and can use

          `git push origin main`


---

## Aside: Default Git Branch

- Most of the modern `git` installations use `main` as the name of the default branch. 

- In the older installations you may still encounter `master` as the name of the default branch. 

- The change was made in 2020. 

--

- Why do you think this change was made? 

--

- 

---

## Basic Git Commands: Pulling

- Suppose that the remote repository might have been changed in some way since
  the last time you worked on your local copy. Maybe you added a file on the
  remote or someone else who had permission did so.

  You must __always__ retrieve the latest copy before starting more work locally!
  The simplest way to do this is to "pull" the changes.

  By default the remote is named `origin`.

     - To "pull" the current state of the remote, in this simple case, you can use

          `git pull`   (or for clarity `git pull origin` )
          
--

- Under the Hood: Pull = Fetch + Merge, 
--
when you run `git pull`, Git is actually doing two things:
    
  - **`git fetch`**: Go to the remote (origin) and download all the new data, but don't touch your local work yet.
  - **`git merge`**: Try to combine those remote changes into your current local branch.

- **Why does this matter?** If you and a teammate edited the same line, the `fetch` will succeed, but the `merge` will trigger a merge conflict. (Sometimes it may be useful to be able to separate the two steps.)

# Simple Example

---

## Create a Repository and Track a First File

- Create a new folder for your project
```
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
  ```
  
- Initialize the repository
```
git init
```
--

- Create a file
```
echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
```
  (or create a text file in your favorite text editor)
  
--

- Check the status
```
git status
```

  the output should be: "untracked files: hello.txt"

--

- Stage and commit, and then check the status again 
```
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add hello.txt"
git status
```

---
## Modifying and "Saving" Progress 

- Modify the file
```
echo "Git is powerful!" >> hello.txt
```
--

- See what changed
```
git diff
```

  (`git diff` shows you the exact lines added (+) or removed (-) before you commit)

--

- Commit the change
```
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Update hello.txt with a new sentence"
```

---

## Viewing the Timeline 

- Show the full history
```
git log
```


- Show a condensed version
```
git log --oneline
```
--

  expected output should be something like: 
  ```
  a1b2c3d Update hello.txt with a new sentence
  e5f6g7h Initial commit: Add hello.txt
  ```

  Each commit has a unique "ID" (the hash) that allows you to jump back to that exact moment in time later if you need to revert some changes.


---
## Adding More Files


- Create more files
```
touch README.md index.html
```

  (this creates two empty files) 
  
--

- Check the status and notice how the files are listed in different categories.
```
git status
```

--

- Add the first file and check the status again (notice that now the files are in three different categories) 
```
git README.md 
git status 
```

- Then add the second file and check status 
```
git index.html 
git status 
```

--

- Commit the changes (i.e., the two new files) 
```
git commit -m "Add README and index files"
```

---

## Ooops! 
### I deleted a file, how do I get it back? 

What happens if you accidentally delete your work? For example, let's delete `hello.txt` file 

```
rm hello.txt
```

--

Since we **committed** the files, `git` has a backup in the local database. 
And often, `git` will tell you what to do.

Run 
```
git status
```

and look at the output.

--

Now, follow `git`'s suggestion and run 

```
git restore hello.txt
``` 

---
## Bigger Ooops!
### Undoing a "Committed" Deletion

Sometimes you delete a file, commit that deletion, and realize two days later you actually needed it. Because it was in a **previous commit**, it's not gone.

--

name: restore-committed

- Delete the file and COMMIT the change
```
rm hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Delete hello.txt because I thought I didn't need it"
```

--

- Look at your history to find where it last existed
```
git log --oneline
```

  the output should start with something like 
  ```
  a1b2c3d Delete hello.txt...
  e5f6g7h Add README and index files    <---   (The file existed here!)
  ```

--

- Restore the file from that specific commit ID
```
git restore --source e5f6g7h hello.txt
```

  `--source` this tells `git`, "Don't look in the current state; look inside this specific snapshot from the past."

--

- The file is now back in the working directory. We need to stage it and commit it, 

---
template: restore-committed

- An alternative restore method works if you know that the file existed in the previous commit. In that case, you can use 
```
git restore --source HEAD~1 hello.txt
```

  `HEAD~1` means the commit right before the current one 

--

🚨 You need `git` version 2.23 or higher to use `restore`. 


---
## Where is my data? The .git/objects folder

- Git doesn't store "files"; it stores **objects**.

- When we use `git add` a file, `git` does several things:
  - Compresses the content.
  - Calculates a unique **SHA-1 hash** (a 40-character ID).
  - Stores it in `.git/objects` using that hash as the filename.

--

- Can we _look_ at these objects 

--

  We can see the files, but they are not text files and their names are not really readable, so we cannot just look at them using standard file viewers or even figure out what is what in a file browser. </br> 

--

  We need to use `git` tools:

  `git cat-file -t <hash>`  - show the object type identified by object represented by this hash 
  `git cat-file -p <hash>`  - pretty-print the contents of the object represented by this hash 


---

## Where is my data? The .git/objects folder

- Run `git log --oneline` to see the hashes for commit objects. Select one of them, say it's `HASH`.

--

- Run `git cat-file -t HASH` - this will tell us the type of this object: its a commit object.

--

- Run `git cat-file -p HASH` - this time we'll see the author, the commit message, the date and the __tree__ hash, say it is `TREE`.  

--

- Now, run `git cat-file -p TREE` to see the list of files in tree object with hash TREE in the commit object with hash HASH. 

--

- Pick a hash for a file object, say it is `FILE`. 

- Run `git cat-file -p FILE` to see the contents of the actual file. 

--

ASIDE</br>
Assuming that you still have the repository with files exactly as they were created in the previous slides, take a look at the hashes for files 
README.md and index.html. What do you notice? 

--

  - They are exactly the same because both files are empty. The hash is created based on the content of the file. So identical files have the same objects irrespective of their names.
